/**
 * ADAPTER pattern
 *
 * The adapter class has a Client class that expects some object type, and it has an Adaptee class that offers the same
 * feature but by exposing a different interface.
 *
 * Following are three key point for Adapter pattern
 * 1. A target interface (ie MediaPlayer)
 * 2. An Adaptee class (could be from library or external app) which will use the Adapter class (MP4Player, WavPlayer)
 * 3. The Adapter class which translate the request from Adaptee to a know functionality
