/**
 * SINGLETON design pattern
 *
 * To create a singleton class, a class must implement the following properties:
 *
 * - Create a private constructor of the class to restrict object creation outside of the class.
 * - Create a private attribute of the class type that refers to the single object.
 * - Create a public static method that allows us to create and access the object we created.
 *   Inside the method, we will create a condition that restricts us from creating more than one object.
