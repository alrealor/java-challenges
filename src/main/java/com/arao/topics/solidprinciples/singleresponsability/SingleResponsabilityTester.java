/**
 * 1. Single Responsibility Principle
 *
 * Every class in Java should have a single job to do. To be precise, there should only be one reason to change a class.
 *
 * Here’s an example of a Java class that does not follow the single responsibility principle (SRP):
 *
 *  public class Vehicle {
 *      public void printDetails() {}
 *      public double calculateValue() {}
 *      public void addVehicleToDB() {}
 *  }
 *  The Vehicle class has three separate responsibilities: reporting, calculation, and database.
 *  By applying SRP, we can separate the above class into three classes with separate responsibilities.
